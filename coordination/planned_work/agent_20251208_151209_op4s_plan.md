# Agent Work Plan: agent_20251208_151209_op4s

**Date:** 2025-12-08
**Agent ID:** agent_20251208_151209_op4s
**Status:** In Progress

## Conflict Check Results

- Active agents working: None (first agent to use coordination system)
- Files I want to modify: `.gitignore`, `AIDeveloper/src/sub-workflow-queue.ts`, `AIDeveloper/.eslintrc.json`
- Conflict status: NO CONFLICTS
- Alternative options if conflicts exist: N/A

## Planned Actions

### 1. Setup Agent Coordination System

**What:** Create the coordination directory structure and initial configuration files for multi-agent coordination.

**Why:** The task instructions require a multi-agent coordination protocol to prevent conflicts when multiple agents work simultaneously. This infrastructure is essential for safe parallel development.

**Files:**
- `coordination/active_work_registry.json`
- `coordination/completed_work_log.json`
- `coordination/planned_work_queue.json`
- `coordination/agent_locks/` directory
- `coordination/planned_work/` directory
- `coordination/stale_locks/` directory

### 2. Review and Commit Pending Changes

**What:** Review and commit the existing pending changes in the working directory:
- `.gitignore` - Added Claude Agent Farm entries
- `AIDeveloper/src/sub-workflow-queue.ts` - Bug fix to return grandparent's next workflow

**Why:** These changes appear to be legitimate improvements that should be committed:
1. The `.gitignore` changes add entries for Claude Agent Farm artifacts (heartbeats, state files, reports)
2. The sub-workflow-queue.ts change fixes a bug where the grandparent workflow advancement wasn't being returned to the caller, which would cause execution issues

**Evidence of correctness:**
- The sub-workflow-queue change follows the existing pattern in the function
- TypeScript type checking passes (`npm run typecheck`)
- The change is a simple return statement that was missing

### 3. Setup ESLint Configuration

**What:** Create ESLint configuration for the TypeScript project.

**Why:** The project has ESLint in devDependencies but no configuration file, causing `npm run lint` to fail. Having proper linting helps maintain code quality.

**Files:**
- `AIDeveloper/.eslintrc.json`

## Coordination Section

- **Files to be locked:** `.gitignore`, `AIDeveloper/src/sub-workflow-queue.ts`, `AIDeveloper/.eslintrc.json`, `coordination/*`
- **Features to be claimed:** setup_coordination_system, commit_pending_changes, setup_eslint_config
- **Estimated work duration:** 30 minutes
- **Fallback plan if conflicts arise:** N/A - no other agents currently active

## Testing Plan

1. Run `npm run typecheck` to verify TypeScript compilation
2. Run `npm run lint` after ESLint setup to verify configuration
3. Build the project to ensure nothing is broken

## Notes

The project is TypeScript-based (not Python as the task instructions mentioned). The "Python Best Practices" guides mentioned in the instructions do not exist in this project. Work will focus on TypeScript/Node.js best practices instead.
